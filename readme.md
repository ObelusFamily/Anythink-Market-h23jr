## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
1.run "docker-compose up" in your terminal 
2. once the docker finish loading up the backend should be able to run. therefore you should be able to see a success message on the following link - https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-h23jr-6w44vq6qr95h5g6g-3001.githubpreview.dev/register
3.after success message of the backend you should enter the link for testing the frontend which is the following - https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-h23jr-6w44vq6qr95h5g6g-3001.githubpreview.dev/register
